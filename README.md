# Machin-Learning

Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence. As machine learning is increasingly used to find models, conduct analysis and make decisions without the final input from humans, it is equally important not only to provide resources to advance algorithms and methodologies but also to invest to attract more stakeholders.

This article on machine learning projects with Python tries to do just that: equip developers of today and tomorrow with tools they can use to better understand, assess, and shape machine learning to achieve success make sure it serves us all.

All machine learning projects below are solved and explained using the Python programming language. If youâ€™re new to Python and want to explore it more before working on the machine learning projects below, you can download a free Python ebook from here.
